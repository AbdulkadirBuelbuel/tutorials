# Exercise #15
# ------------
#
# Compute the features of an image with the Harris corner detection. Adjust the parameters using sliders.

import numpy as np
import cv2

# TODO Define a function that detects and draws corners into the image
# Drawing helper variables

# Get a different color array for each of the features/corners

# Draw a circle around each corner

# Show the resulting image

# TODO Define the callback function
# Read paremeters from slider positions

# Run corner detection

# cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack returns corners as floating point values,
# hence convert to integer

# Call the function from above to draw the corners into the image

# TODO Load example image as color image

# TODO Clone image

# TODO Create a greyscale image for the corner detection

# TODO Create a window with sliders and show resulting image

# TODO Create sliders for all parameters and one callback function

# Wait until a key is pressed and end the application
